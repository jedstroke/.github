## Collaboration and Governance

- Collaborative Projects: When our membership reaches 3000, we establish an agreed governance model that allows all members to actively collaborate on the seed project, <a href="https://jedshock.com#CBTWeb3" target="_blank">CBTWeb3<a/>, and future initiatives.
- Infrastructural Costs: For every idea or project proposal, the founders or collaborators are responsible for providing minimal infrastructural costs to aid development. We encourage shared efforts and the collective ownership of projects.

### PS
And note your subscription(s) will be dormant (meaning it won't be counting toward its expiration, and you're subscribed and waiting for launch) until we have gained 3000 members & a collectively established governance model then everyone can access the seed project and other future initiatives.
Additionally, Hack On The Kitchen Sink can be considered a bootcamp for individuals looking to accelerate their learning pace. By actively participating in our community, members have the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge, experience, and potentially be a part of something big. We provide an environment that fosters growth and enables individuals to connect with like-minded individuals and explore exciting opportunities.
